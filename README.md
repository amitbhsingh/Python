# Machine Learning Mastery with python

## Lessons
* Define Problem :Investigate and characterize the problem in order to better understand the goals of the project.
* Analyze Data: Use descriptive statistics and visualization to better understand the data you have available.
* Prepare Data: Use data transforms in order to better expose the structure of the prediction problem to modeling algorithms.
* Evaluate Algorithms: Design a test harness to evaluate a number of standard algorithms on the data and select the top few to investigate further.
* Improve Results: Use algorithm tuning and ensemble methods to get the most out of well-performing algorithms on your data.
* Present Results: Finalize the model, make predictions and present results.

### Projects are completed using UCI library of public datasets
###### Recipes : A Catalog of recipes provides a repertoire.
* Recipes are code snippets not tutorials.
* Recipes provide just enough code to work.
* Recipes are demonstrative not exhaustive.
* Recipes run as-is and produce a result.
* Recipes assume that required libraries are installed.
* Recipes use built-in datasets or datasets provided in specific libraries.

## Claimed outcomes of book I intend to learn and practice.
* How to work through a small to medium sized dataset end-to-end.
* How to deliver a model that can make accurate predictions on new unseen data. * How to complete all subtasks of a predictive modeling problem with Python.
* How to learn new and different techniques in Python and SciPy.
* How to get help with Python machine learning.


# Chapter 2
## Python ecosystem for machine learning: Python is dominant and general programming langauge which can be used for achieving multiple language

### 2.2 SciPy: 
* NumPy: A foundation for SciPy that allows you to efficiently work with data in arrays. 
* Matplotlib: Allows you to create 2D charts and plots from data.
* Pandas: Tools and data structures to organize and analyze your data.

### How to be effective in python : become familiar with SciPy and specifically
* You will prepare your data as NumPy arrays for modeling in machine learning algorithms.
* You will use Matplotlib (and wrappers of Matplotlib in other frameworks) to create plots
and charts of your data.
* You will use Pandas to load explore and better understand your data.
#### 2.4 & 2.5 Intro to scikit-learn setting up python which I already have had setup


# Chapter 3
